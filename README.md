<h1>About</h1>
<p>Each traveler using WoofPack can either start or join a small pack with other travelers who share common interests in their destination city. Together, they can explore and enjoy their trip. Based on each person’s different personalities/interests, WoofPack offers a filtered selection of nearby events. Our app unlocks the power of serendipity; it's the things that we don't know we want that surprises us the most.</p><br>
<h1>Challenges We Faced</h1>
<p>Everything went smoothly, especially because it was some of our team members’ first time using node.js/express/mongoDB/firebase/expedia APIs. Trying to implement every feature of our app in the allotted time was challenging but we managed to complete the coding in time. We incorporated the expedia API to get the list of nearby local events to suggest to users based on their preferences, instead of having users manually searching for what they want.</p><br>

<h1>Our Stack</h1>
<p>MongoDB, Express, Node.js, RxJs, Retrofit, Firebase, Google Maps API, Kotlin, Java, Expedia API</p>
